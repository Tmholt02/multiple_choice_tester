@Iconoclasm

Iconoclasm is described as
an argument for the importance of visual culture.
crime against humanity.
meaningless destruction.
an emphasis on the lack of meaning and importance of visual artifacts.

Iconoclasm is seen as ironic because
the destruction demonstrates the power of the image.
those who were destroying art were simultaneously making their own forms of art.
the destruction costs money and resources for those who destroy the pieces.
the art was being remade on even larger scales, than the pieces that were destroyed.

Early Protestantism viewed art
with a suspicion that resulted in the destruction of Christian art.
as a tool that was useful for teaching the masses.
as a way to gain access to the divine.
as unimportant.

Michelangelo's description of his art process with sculpture is iconoclastic because
he removes and destroys the marble to reveal the art.
he breaks with traditional norms.
he destroyed many pieces that he deemed imperfect.
his work demonstrates the danger of images.

Iconoclasm is first and foremost a problem of
bodies.
ideas.
culture.
technique.

@Adorno: Art and Religion

According to Adorno, unity between art and religion only occurs in societies that are
hierarchical and closed.
libertarian.
communistic.
free to practice religion as they choose.

According to Adorno, art is and always has been
a force of protest of the humane against the pressure of domineering institutions.
a way to express the spiritual in the mundane world.
an expression of the human spirit of creativity.
an expression of technique and skilled practice.

The only way to save the spell of art is
denial of the spell itself.
create works of modern art.
for the masses to become educated.
to revert back to religious origins.

According to Adorno, to say that art, religion, and philosophy are identical is to
render each harmless and impotent.
demonstrate the universality of each.
to demonstrate our desire for permanence.
is to affirm the power of each.

According to Adorno, in order to make a work about something greater than oneself the artist should
reflect on his or her unique material circumstance.
attempt to tap into universal ideas.
make ideas his or her concept.
reflect on the history of art and incorporate this into his or her work.

Philosophy
Communication
Religion
Language

society has progressed past the need for art.
that modern art is no longer relevant.

it is generally intolerant and monistic in practice.
most art contains a creation story.
it participates in a search for a higher power.
it unites and brings people together.
